        <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup instructions,
          they've moved to <a href="#">their own section</a>. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,

        <p>
          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and the app
          platform&apos;s native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform&apos;s APIs as
          well as to
          describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="span-italic">bundles of
            reusable, nestable code.</span>
          You
          can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let&apos;s cover how components work in React
          Native.

        <h2>react fundamentals <span>Chapter 3</span></h2>
        <p>React Native runs on <a href="#">React</a>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces with
          the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or can serve
          as
          a refresher course.
        </p>
        <p>We&apos;re going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <p><span class="span-bold">+ components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
          examples: friendly,
          approachable
          creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>
        <p><span class="span-bold">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements
          inside JavaScript
          like so:
         <span class="gray-bg">&lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.</p>
        <p>The React docs have <a href="#">a comprehensive guide to JSX</a> you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript,
          you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="gray-bg">name</span> for the cat, name, and embedding it with curly
          braces inside <span class="gray-bg">&lt;/Text&gt;</span></p>
        <p>
          <span class="span-bold">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="span-bold">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how
          components render,
          state is like a
          component&apos;s personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that comes
          from
          user interaction. State gives your components memory!
        </p>

        <h2>handling text input <span>Chapter 4</span></h2>
        <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span class="span-italic">onChangeText</span>  prop that takes a
          function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
          called when the text is submitted.</p>
        <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
          this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob" would be
          translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
