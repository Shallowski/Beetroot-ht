          Known as some of the fastest meteors around, the Leonids blaze
          across the night sky annually during the month of November.
          Historically, they are considered to be one of the most impressive
          meteor showers on record, largely due to the meteor storm they form
          roughly every 33 years, causing thousands of meteors to rain down in
          the night sky.

        <p>
          The Leonid meteor shower is active through December 2, alongside the
          tail end of the North Taurid meteor shower. Around their peak, sky
          gazers could potentially observe 10 to 15 meteors per hour. The
          meteors move in the opposite direction of Earths rotation, causing
          an almost head-on collision with the atmosphere when they intersect.
          The space rocks are often recorded shooting through the sky at 44
          miles per second (71 kilometers per second) — some of the fastest
          meteors produced from one of the major annual meteor showers,
          according to Robert Lunsford, fireball report coordinator for the
          American Meteor Society.

        <h2>Spotting a meteor</h2>
        <p>
          The best time to stay out to look for a meteor is this Thursday
          evening into Friday morning, but the meteor society has predicted
          that Earth may also pass through a condensed stream of debris left
          behind in 1733 from the Leonids parent comet, Tempel-Tuttle. If this
          occurs, for a short time on Saturday morning at around 1 a.m. ET,
          there could be up to 250 meteors visible per hour, according to
          Lunsford.
          If you are on the night side of Earth during this time,
          you could spot a meteor, but its best to keep an eye on the eastern horizon
          to increase your chances. (Those
          on the West Coast of the
          United States will have an even shorter window to see this outburst,
          as Leo, the constellation from which the meteors appear to radiate
          from, will still be below the horizon.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <q> Weve gone back hundreds of years — because the comet passes through t
            he inner solar system maybe
            every 33 years — so each one of those paths has been mapped out,</q> Lunsford said.
          <q>We
            can pretty much nail the time and the date, but we have no idea what the density of
            the particles are. So, it could be
            exciting, or it could be a dud.</q>
          The meteor society recommends going outside at least 30 minutes prior to the showers peaks,
          to allow your eyes
          to adjust to the dark. Since the moon will rise near the same time as the radiant constellation,
          its best to
          look in a direction away from its light.
          <q>Anybody can contribute scientifically useful information by just taking a few notes on
            these meteors. … You can
            go out and count how many you can see.</q> Lunsford said.
          <q> Its fun, its cheap and its a good way for families to get together.
            If your skies are clear at that time, I wouldnt want to miss it.
          </q>
